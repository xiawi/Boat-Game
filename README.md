# Boat Game
 Boat Game created for Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals Class. No UI. We were supposed to show our understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.
## Features
- A randomly generated map every time the game starts.
- Winner names and scores get saved into a file.
- `trap` tiles and `current` tiles with varying strengths are shown.
- Simple functionality that makes the game easy to play for anyone.
## Drawbacks
- Not very interactive as only one button needs to be pressed throughout the whole game.
## What did I learn?
How to utilise OOP principles in a simple game that requires no UI implementation.
